# Zextor-FPS

As it might be understood, the game is named as Zextor and is full of fun. The game incorporates modern game trends. We hope that everyone enjoys playing the game.

The primary objective of the game is for the player to eliminate all the bots present on the level. Throughout the level, there are various items placed on different locations where player can pick up and use to aid their way on the level. Our game is a first person shooter game. Commencing from the real life-like graphics, it consists of enemy bots, very user-friendly UI and game environment provided with tutorials at every step for a new user.
